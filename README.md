# RAP repository template

:exclamation: Warning: this repository may contain references internal to NHS England that cannot be accessed publicly

This project aims to explore the potential uses and efficacy of "Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG) within NHS England.

This will principally involve:

* [x] **WP1**: Making a simple RAG pipeline -> [here](dev.ipynb)
* [ ] **WP2**: Make reusable current code
* [ ] **WP3**: Methodology exploration - how to take RAG further
* [ ] **WP4**: Evaluation
* [ ] **WP5**: Explainer

## Description

> Provide more detailed overview of the project, including (if relevant) a description of the publication process.

This repository is intended to function as a template for Python RAP projects at NHS England.

You can learn more about project structure and why it's important in the ['project structure and packaging guide'](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/python/project-structure-and-packaging/) of the RAP community of practice Github repo, a central source of RAP knowledge.

_You can edit any part of this document. The licence section **must be edited** before publishing this repository publicly. For more information about publishing your project please see the ['how to publish your code in the open' guide](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/implementing_RAP/how-to-publish-your-code-in-the-open/)._

### WP1: Make a simple RAP pipeline

* We need to make a simple RAP pipeline to use to explore this technique
* It doesn't need to be that complex - but we do need to be able to turn the "RAG" component on or off - so 
we can test what effect it has.

The basic structure is described below:

 ```mermaid
    graph LR

    A[Hard] -->|Text| B(Round)
    B --> C{Decision}
    C -->|One| D[Result 1]
    C -->|Two| E[Result 2]
```

### WP2: Make current code reusable 

### WP3: Methodology exploration

### WP4: Evaluation

### WP5: Explainer

* make resources which explan this

## Prerequisites

> If applicable, list the items a user needs to be able to use your repository, such as a certain version of a programming language. It can be useful to link to documentation on how to install these items.

* Python (> 3.0)

## Getting Started

> Tell the user how to get started (using a numbered list can be helpful). List one action per step with example code if possible.

1. Clone the repository. To learn about what this means, and how to use Git, see the [Git guide](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/git/using-git-collaboratively/).

```
git clone <insert URL>
```

2. Set up your environment, _either_ using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) or [conda](https://www.anaconda.com/). For more information on how to use virtual environments and why they are important,. see the [virtual environments guide](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/python/virtual-environments/why-use-virtual-environments/).

### Using pip
```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For Visual Studio Code it is necessary that you change your default interpreter to the virtual environment you just created .venv. To do this use the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-P, search for Python: Select interpreter and select .venv from the list. examples/example_create_publication.py
```

## Project structure

> Provide the user with an outline of your repository structure. This template is primarily designed for publications teams at NHS England. Projects with different requirements (e.g. more complex documentation and modelling) should look to [DrivenData's cookiecutter project structure](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#directory-structure), as well as our [Community of Practice](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/training_resources/python/project-structure-and-packaging/) for guidance.

### `root`

In the highest level of this repository (known as the 'root'), there is one Python file: `create_publication.py`. This top level file should be the main place where users interact with the code, where you store the steps to create your publication.

This file currently runs a set of example steps using example data.

### `src`

This directory contains the meaty parts of the code. By organising the code into logical sections, we make it easier to understand, maintain and test. Moreover, tucking the complex code out of the way means that users don't need to understand everything about the code all at once.

* `data_connections.py` handles reading data in and writing data back out.
* `processing` folder contains the core business logic.
* `utils` folder contains useful reusable functions (e.g. to set up logging, and importing configuration settings from `config.toml`)
* `write_excel.py` contains functions relating to the final part of the pipeline, any exporting or templating happens here. This is a simplistic application of writing output code to an Excel spreadsheet template (.xlsx). A good example of this application is: [NHS sickness absence rates publication](https://github.com/NHSDigital/absence-rates). We highly recommend to use [Automated Excel Production](https://nhsd-git.digital.nhs.uk/data-services/analytics-service/iuod/automated-excel-publications) for a more in depth Excel template production application.
